          The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is used to store information about users, hosts, and many other
          objects. LDAP injection is a server-side attack, which could allow sensitive information about users and hosts
          represented in an LDAP structure to be disclosed, modified, or inserted. This is done by manipulating input parameters
          afterwards passed to internal search, add, and modify functions.
