            Proper configuration of the single elements that make up an application architecture is important in order to prevent
            mistakes that might compromise the security of the whole architecture.
            <br/>
            Configuration review and testing is a critical task in creating and maintaining an architecture. This is because many
            different systems will be usually provided with generic configurations that might not be suited to the task they will
            perform on the specific site theyâ€™re installed on.
            <br/>
            While the typical web and application server installation will contain a lot of functionality (like application examples,
            documentation, test pages) what is not essential should be removed before deployment to avoid post-install
            exploitation.
