          The misuse and invalid use of of valid functionality can identify attacks attempting to enumerate the web application,
          identify weaknesses, and exploit vulnerabilities. Tests should be undertaken to determine whether there are
          application-layer defensive mechanisms in place to protect the application.
          <br/>
          The lack of active defenses allows an attacker to hunt for vulnerabilities without any recourse. The applicationâ€™s owner
          will thus not know their application is under attack
