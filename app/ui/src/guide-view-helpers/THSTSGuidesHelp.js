            The HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) feature lets a web application inform the browser through the use of a
            special response header that it should never establish a connection to the specified domain servers using un-
            encrypted HTTP. Instead, it should automatically establish all connection requests to access the site through HTTPS. It
            also prevents users from overriding certificate errors.
            <br/>
            Considering the importance of this security measure it is prudent to verify that the web site is using this HTTP header in
            order to ensure that all the data travels encrypted between the web browser and the server.

                The presence of the HSTS header can be confirmed by examining the serverâ€™s response through an intercepting proxy
                or by using curl
