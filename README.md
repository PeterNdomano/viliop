Integrated Pentesting Environment made Using Python and NodeJS (Electron, React - <front-end>)

My key focus is on:-
1) Productive workflow during pentesting hence catching more bugs
2) Integrating robust tools and scanners
3) Easy & Efficient reporting so that someone else can extend your pentesting project basing just on your report.
4) And more........
Feel free to suggest features on github repos of this project

## Work in progress, beta version available.
